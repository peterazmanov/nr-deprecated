# py-nr

*Current Version: v1.4.10*

A wide variety of Python utilities for various applications. The contents of
this library is mainly composed of code that I developed for functionality that
I needed in Cinema 4D plugins, though only little is actually restricted to
Cinema 4D.

The library is compatible with Python 2 and 3 for the most part. It does not
require any dependencies.
